# encryption_decryption
A message encrypting and decrypting program using Vigen√®re encryption

Rules
Users have to enter a message to encrypt and a key of encryption (these values must be in ASCII String!).
Then the program will : 
1. Show the Vigenere table
2. Encrypt the user's message using the key entered by the user
3. Decrypt this encrypted message to show the initial message entered by the user

Workflow
1. Choose the encryption method by doing some research
2. Imagine the final result
3. Plan the project
4. Code the game
5. Handle errors

Organization
I used an agile project planning online tool Trello.
